**Build cloud-ready web applications using React 17 with Hooks and GraphQL**

## What is this book about?
This book takes a hands-on approach to implementing modern web technologies and the associated methodologies for building full-stack apps. You’ll begin by gaining a strong understanding of TypeScript and how to use it to build high-quality web apps. The chapters that follow delve into client-side development with React using the new Hooks API and Redux. Next, you’ll get to grips with server-side development with Express, including authentication with Redis-based sessions and accessing databases with TypeORM. The book will then show you how to use Apollo GraphQL to build web services for your full-stack app. Later, you’ll learn how to build GraphQL schemas and integrate them with React using Hooks. Finally, you’ll focus on how to deploy your application onto an NGINX server using the AWS cloud.
By the end of this book, you’ll be able to build and deploy complete high-performance web applications using React, Node, and GraphQL.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Discover TypeScript’s most important features and how they can be used to improve code quality and maintainability
* Understand what React Hooks are and how to build React apps using them
* Implement state management for your React app using Redux
* Set up an Express project with TypeScript and GraphQL from scratch
* Build a fully functional online forum app using React and GraphQL
